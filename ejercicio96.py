#ejercicio96
#In this exercise you will write a function that determines whether or not a password
#is good. We will define a good password to be a one that is at least 8 characters
#long and contains at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and at
#least one number. Your function should return true if the password passed to it as
#its only parameter is good. Otherwise it should return false. Include a main program
#that reads a password from the user and reports whether or not it is good. Ensure
#that your main program only runs when your solution has not been imported into
#another file.
