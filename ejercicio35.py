#Ejercicio 35
#It is commonly said that one human year is equivalent to 7 dog years. However this
#simple conversion fails to recognize that dogs reach adulthood in approximately two
#years. As a result, some people believe that it is better to count each of the first two
#human years as 10.5 dog years, and then count each additional human year as 4 dog
#years.
