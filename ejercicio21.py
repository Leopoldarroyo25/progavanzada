# Ejercicio 21
#The area of a triangle can be computed using the following formula, where b is the
#length of the base of the triangle, and h is its height:
#area = b Ã— h/2
#Write a program that allows the user to enter values for b and h. The program
#should then compute and display the area of a triangle with base length b and height h.
b=int(input('ingresa base \n'))
h=int(input('ingresa altura \n'))
area= (b*h)/2
print("area= %.4f" % area)
